# Party Mode Button
**Because every dorm room should have a party button.**  

After outfitting our dorm room with light strips, a disco ball, a projector, speakers, and a lava lamp, my roommate and I sat there wondering what else we could possibly do to make our freshman dorm any cooler.

What if, we thought, there was a single button that one could press to active the lights and the music all at the same time.
And thus, the idea for the *Party Mode Button* was born.

Using an Arduino with a button, audio output, and an IR transmitter, we wired up the party mode button. With the press of the button, the music would start playing and the IR transmitter would send a signal to activate the lights.  

We could program the transmitter to send out different signals, turning the lights to any color or pattern that we wanted. Holding down the button would activate the [secret mode](https://youtu.be/YC9cG_QDJyo) along with special music ;)

All in all, my roommate and I are very happy with the how our room turned out.
